### What I learned

First of all I learned to better organize my folder structure into abstracts, base, components etc. Probably could have been better, but helped me during work when I needed to find something quickly and I will try to follow this approach with non-React projects.  

I tried to follow BEM methodology and still learning that. I aimed at creating reusable components, for example pricing-plan card.  
One fragment that I would like to show  is this one, where I created generic class "pricing-plan" and 2 modifying classes "pricing-plan--free" and "pricing-plan--paid" which differ in some visual aspects:



```css
.pricing-plan--free {
  background-color: $color-primary;
  color: $color-white;

  &::before {
    background: url('../assets/icon-free.svg');
    width: 2.875rem;
    height: 2.875rem;
  }
}

.pricing-plan--paid {
  background-color: $color-accent;
  color: $color-bg;
  padding: 4rem 2.40625rem 3rem;

  &::before {
    background: url('../assets/icon-paid.svg');
    width: 3.1875rem;
    height: 4.0625rem;
  }
}

.pricing-plan--free .pricing-plan__feature::before {
  background: url('../assets/icon-check-free.svg') no-repeat;
}

.pricing-plan--paid .pricing-plan__feature::before {
  background: url('../assets/icon-check.svg') no-repeat;
}

.pricing-plan--free .pricing-plan__text {
  color: rgba($color-white, .6);
}

.pricing-plan--paid .pricing-plan__text {
  color: rgba($color-bg, .6);
}
```
